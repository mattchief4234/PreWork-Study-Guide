## This work is the digital representation of my work in 3 different computer languages, namely, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was AMAZING to activly learn about these languages and their various uses and roles in making sure that webpages are viewed and explored correctly, or as the programers and designers intended. It was such a unique opportunity to also find out why certain lines of code were not working and it was a stupifying discovery to find out that all that was missing was a semi-colon or a letter was lowercase instead of being capitalized.

## Installation

the required steps are as follows:
 Step 1) Develop the "bear bones" of the website using HTML. Input the correct informmation and where that infromatoin is to sit and in which order they are to be arranged.
 Step 2) Futher optimize that order from chaos using CSS. Give the website a cleaner and more user friendly look by inputting border and colors to specific lines of code. This also makes it much easier to read.
 Step 3) Further increase the interactability of the website by using JavaScript. Allow the user to not only ready but interact with the website. This is still limited and needs to be investigated further, but there is more interatabliilty because of Javascript now.

## Usage

This website is to be used as a "hub" of sorts. A place for me and any others to refference and check back on for more information on coding practices or tutorials. This is to be a collection or archinve of all of my notes on coding and its many languages. I hope to continue to improve and refine this website as we continue on in the course.


## Credits

I want to thank the teachers, instructors and tutors at the University of Utah and their patience in not only creating this amazing course but in their patience and long suffereing in teaching me and helping me further understand beyond what they are trying to achieve. Teach how to do it, the application and also the thought process behidn it.
